      <h2>Bypassing 2 factor authentication</h2>
<p>if the user is first prompted to enter a password and then prompted to enter a verification code on a seprate page, the user is effectively logged in state before they have entered the verification code. 
you can see if you can get to "logged in only" pages </p>
<p>Flawed 2 factor authentication logic :- </p>
<p>you login -&gt; cookie is set -&gt; you give the verification code along with the cookie to let server  determine which account the user is trying to access</p>
<p>In this case, an attacker could log in using their own credentials but then change the value of the account cookie to any arbitrary username when submitting the verification code.</p>
<p>this is dangerous as they will be able to brute force any arbtrirary user </p>
<h4>Brute forcing</h4>
<p>you can try to brute force simple ones, 
but there can be times when they log you out
so for that , you got the macros , you just keep relogging and retrying </p>
<h4>Why no basic auth</h4>
<p>some browsers usually attempt https first </p>
<p>firefox does not, if a http link is present, it will straight go to port 80 </p>
<p>Why the fallback still lets a Basic-Auth leak happen
User types example.com (or clicks a plain-HTTP link).</p>
<p>Browser first attempts https://example.com/.</p>
<p>Attacker interferes — blocks packets or serves an invalid cert.</p>
<p>Browser’s auto-upgrade logic gives up and retries http://example.com/.</p>
<p>Attacker replies with 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Basic, harvests the credentials the moment the user (or the browser) resends the request with Authorization: Basic ….</p>
