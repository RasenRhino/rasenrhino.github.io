      <p>so here are a few things </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates seemingly on a whim, such as a quarter-point increase because "it felt right." A shift from a 1-1.25% to a 4-4.25% range feels monumental, guided by forces that appear anything but deterministic. This is where a comparison to experienced intuition, like a father's gut feeling, becomes relevant. We are often told not to trust non-deterministic systems, like a machine learning model, because their outputs aren't guaranteed. Yet, we rely on them. A seasoned expert's intuition, much like a well-trained algorithm, is often correct, and its convenience is a factor we cannot afford to downplay. It works, more often than not.</p>
<p>My dad gives suggestions based on his gut. he has experience. it is like saying "a ml model is not deterministic so we shouldnt trust ut" , which is true, but it is right good enough times , is convinient enough , and this sentence might downplay convinience, so i would urge the reader to explicitly DONT downplay the convinience factor, 
PS :  more often than not, dad is right</p>
<p>but, does it really get that much deterministic on-chain? what data do we have onchain that we dont have offchain (on chain being blockchain , and all the other mumbo jumbo around it , technically it is inaccurate to call it blockchain , but this writeup is for a broader populace)</p>
<p>The internet is often hailed as the potential bedrock of a "true democracy," a platform for pure, direct governance. I disagree. The notion that direct democracy always yields optimal outcomes is flawed, as it often overlooks the necessity of long-term, strategic thinking, a trait the general populace, focused on immediate needs, may lack.</p>
<p>I disagree with a few ideas.</p>
<p>artifact 1: demonitisation in a country. (like it did in India)</p>
<p>people would have argued against it, but that time, less than 50% of the population had banks. now thats not the case. changing the order requires long term thinking, which the populus lacks. so , if they were to vote in a decentralised system , would it be alright? imagine you, as an 18 year old, voting for or against de-monetization. your dad has a cash flow based business. would you? </p>
<p>chances are if that was the system, a lot of reformative changes wouldn't have been a thing. </p>
<p>But we need to understand the point of democracy. It is not to make very optimised decisions, rather it acts as a hedge against from really bad things happening. </p>
<p>So, even if we transition to the all-hail-internet democracy model. it wont really bring a golden age , better times yes, but they will come with their own price. </p>
<p>Internet allows for more discrete tribalism. Advantages : you have much larger breadth of identities to choose from , disadvantage : too many cooks spoil the broth. </p>
<p>How is the broth spoiled then ? </p>
<p>globalisation is not really that good of a thing. too much and it causes issues. and this has the potential to make it too much </p>
<p>also , more discrete triabl groups  , uhh ...... we cannot handle that. </p>
<p>We think in extremes. Right and the left. Yeses and Nos. not a spectrum. and something exists , an idealogy with a corresponding opposition. or the opposition comes from within. See christainity, one of the most user friendly religions. and we have sects from within , that wont sometimes gel well together. now this example might be another myopic output of the binary thinking, but we wont digress too much and move on </p>
<p>point is, more discrete groups, more opposiing sects. it would be like 18th century india, too many kings, divide and rule possibility high. </p>
<p>there are plenty of points of credibility, no qualitiative counter points, or neutralisation points</p>
