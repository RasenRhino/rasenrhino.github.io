# Red Team & Blue Team Considerations

## Red Team Tools & Tactics

Some notes I made while hanging around CCDC folks. 

### Cobalt Strike
- A powerful red team tool combining **Metasploit** features with **beaconing** capabilities.
- Often leverages `rundll32.exe` for execution.

### XAMPP
- A simple way to establish a reverse shell.

### Kerberoasting
- Exploiting service tickets for credential extraction.

### Windows Hash Storage
- Equivalent to `/etc/hashes` in Linux.
- Located in `C:\Windows\System32\Config\SAM`.
- Unauthorized access to this directory should raise concern.

### LSASS Credential Dumping
- Tools like **Mimikatz** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)) can extract password hashes.
- **LSASS process monitoring** is crucial; unauthorized access may indicate credential theft.
- [Microsoft guide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/05/detecting-and-preventing-lsass-credential-dumping-attacks/) on preventing LSASS attacks.

## System Security & Hardening

### Administrator Account Security
- `net user Administrator *` does **not** save in history (safe for password changes).
- `net user Administrator <random>` **does** save in history (not recommended).

### Group Policy Management
- Use `rsop` to check applied **Group Policies** (they may overlap and disable security settings).
- `gpupdate` updates policies; requires **relogin** and may take time.

### Domain & Workgroup Security
- Profile **domain/workgroup** to understand security implications.
- **Emergency "break glass" accounts** should be pre-configured.
- **Do not disable user accounts** unless necessary.
- **Avoid deleting accounts** when disabling suffices.

### Password & Credential Security
- **Change default passwords** on all systems.
- Cached logins allow authentication without a domain controller.
  - The **number of cached logins** can be adjusted in security settings.
- **Use TOTP-based MFA** (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- Red teams may **manipulate system time** to break TOTP.

## Active Directory & Incident Response

### Common Active Directory Tasks
- **Reset passwords**
- **Create/Delete user accounts**
- **Monitor Splunk logs** (`IP_ADDRESS:8000` for access)

### Security Monitoring
- **Monitor system file access**:
  - `C:\Windows\System32\Config\SAM` (Windows password hashes)
  - If **unprivileged users** access `System32`, investigate immediately.
- **Monitor suspicious application behavior**, especially in:
  - `C:\Intel\`
  - `C:\AMD\` (Red teams often store tools here)

### Windows Privilege Hierarchy
- **SYSTEM**: Most privileged Windows account, equivalent to `root` in Linux.
  - Bypasses most **syscall validation**.
  - Allows **direct hardware access** via drivers.
- **Administrator**: Less privileged than SYSTEM, but still a high-risk account.

## Kubernetes & Cloud Security

### Kubernetes Control Plane Security
- **Raft with etcd** for state management.
- **Longhorn**: Persistent storage management (PVC, PBC).
- **Time-series databases** in Kubernetes (TCSB).

### Cloud Services
- **AWS Lex**: AI-driven chatbot service.
- **Fluentd** ([fluentd.org](https://www.fluentd.org/)): Log aggregation.

## Miscellaneous Security Considerations
- **If a user has an active session**, changes (e.g., password updates) may not take effect until logout.
- Some services may **fail after password changes**, requiring manual intervention.
- **Avoid unnecessary deletions**â€”disable instead.
- Review **NCAE Cyber Games** checklist and set up a **VM** for testing.


## Snort 

there is something like a snort, it is suppsed to be a IDS , can be used as a packet logger or packet sniffer
