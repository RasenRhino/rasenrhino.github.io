      <p>I came across an interesting podcast they were talking about nuclear water management. </p>
<p>So in USA, waste is sent to Nevada (cause its kinda desolate and sealed something there). But in Europe they dig it deep in the ground. Now, France started playing around with nuclear before USA in 1970s. USA was busy playing around with coal while france tried to double down on nuclear. Also, I do believe France aided India to establish its first nuclear reactor in 1969 in Tarapur. </p>
<p>So what is the right/better way ? Dig them into the ground ? </p>
<p>Also it was an assumption that nuclear reactor just turn turbines, apparently someone made one for homes? I need to look into it more. Can we use the heat from a nuclear reactor plant to also execute Haber's process ? Now hear me out, say haber's process requires X amount of energy. (the process of nitrogen fixation, fertilisers are made from it, very resource intensive, something around 400k I suppose and lots of pressure, not sure but plants do it in their legumes under normal conditions?!!). A nuclear reactor runs continuously , it never stops, and what do we need it all the time? I will ask a few electrical engineers I know and rephrase this segment. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading. If you SOMEHOW stumbled across this, do email if you have thoughts of your own.</p>
